Write a script using any of the bash tools including grep and sed, that given a
file with the lines inside it having a comma-separated format, writes the
fields of the line by reversing each pair of fields.  Note that the fields
themselves remain the same.

Sample input:
23,A,49,B,2,C
25,B,27,D,8,
34,B,,F

Sample output:
A,23,B,49,C,2
B,25,D,27,,8
B,34,F,

Note carefully the last two lines.

You may not assume a known number of fields in a file.

You need to write a script using any bash tool including grep and sed to
automate the matching of TAs to students in different days.

A little bit more detail:

Suppose there are n students, m tas and d lab days (all numbered from 1 to ...).

There will be a list that dictates which student can take which lab day.
Create this list as a one-time measure using randomisation.

Create this using weights on the lab days, e.g., 10% on lab day 1, 30% on lab
day 2, etc.  The weights may be read from a file f.

Each ta grades roughly w = n/m students.

Next, divide the tas between the d lab days (assume m > d) such that per day,
roughly w students are graded by each ta.  In a day, the difference between the
number of students graded by a ta cannot be more than 1.

Randomise the allocation of tas to the days.  In each day, randomise the
students assigned to the tas.

Additionally, give the students slots starting from time t with a gap of g
minutes each.

Running this script every week will solve the problem.

You can use *only* bash tools including grep, sed and awk.

Sample input:

n = 11
m = 4
d = 2
File f:
70
30
t = 2:00pm
g = 10 min

Sample output:

Students to lab days:

Day 1 students:
11
9
1
2
6
4
10
8

Day 2 students:
7
3
5

Day 1 mapping:
3 11 2:00
3 9 2:10
3 1 2:20
4 2 2:00
4 6 2:10
4 4 2:20
1 10 2:00
1 8 2:10

Day 2 mapping:
2 7 2:00
2 3 2:10
2 5 2:20

Hint: Look at sort options.
