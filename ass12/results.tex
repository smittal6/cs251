\section{Generalization}
We can generalize this. Let us look at how to do it. The arithmetic proofs remain similar to the 2-digit case. We consider two r-digit numbers.

\input{tables}

\subsection{Case 1}
Let the first digit(the one at $r_{th}$ place) be x. Let the two remaining parts be $y_1$ and $y_2$. Then the product is $10^{2r-2}x(x+1)+y_1*y_2$
\subsection{Case 2}
Let the last digit(the one at ones' place) be x. Let the two remaining parts be $y_1$ and $y_2$. Then the product is $10^{2r-2}(y_1*y_2+x)+x^2$
\subsection{Case 3}
Let the first $r-1$ digits be x. The last digits of two numbers be $y$ and $z$. Then the product is $10^{2r-2}x(x + 1)+yz$
\subsection{Case 4}
Let the last $r-1$ digits be y. The first digits of two numbers be $x$ and $z$. Then the product is $10^{2r-2}(xz+y)+y^2$
